My project attempted to build a convolutional neural network to detect a real Camille Corot painting from a forgery of a Camille Corot painting.

This repository contains the most basic code for the project. Much of the success behind it was in the approach to preprocessing, which is not included in this public repository.

"brushstrokes_model.py" contains the model using the segmented paintings to focus on brushstoke features instead of focusing on shape features like in the models with the entire paintings.

The other testing models are not included in this public repository either.
